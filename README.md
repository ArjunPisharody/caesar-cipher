Caesar Cipher
This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

Features
Encryption: Converts a given message into an encrypted format by shifting the letters according to the shift value provided.
Decryption: Reverts the encrypted message back to the original message using the same shift value.

How it Works
The user inputs a message (any combination of letters and symbols).
A shift value is provided, which determines how far each letter will be shifted in the alphabet.
Non-alphabetic characters like spaces and punctuation are preserved.
The program outputs both the encrypted and decrypted versions of the message.

Usage
To run the program, simply execute the Python script and follow the prompts:
Enter the message you want to encrypt.
Enter the shift value.
The encrypted message will be displayed, followed by the decrypted version.
